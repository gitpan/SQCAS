SQCAS version 0.21
==================


INSTALLATION

Before this system can be installed, you will need to set up a database and edit
and install the config module. In order for the tests to work, you will also
need to insert some data into the DB and remove it after the tests pass.

The database schema is at SQCAS/DB/SQCAS.sql. It was designed for a MySQL
server and will probably need to be modified to be used elsewhere. Once the
database is set up, create a user for the system with SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE
privileges.

The config file is at SQCAS/SQCAS.yaml. All the information therein is read into
the %CONFIG hash which is exported by SQCAS, and so should be available to any
tool in the system.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This system requires these other modules and libraries:

  YAML
  DBI
  DBI::DBD # it was developed and tested using MySQL

To use the modules in the SQCAS::Apache:: tree you will need a mod_perl
enabled Apache webserver. Apache::DBI is higly recommended.
