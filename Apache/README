SQCAS/Apache version 0.01
=========================

Some quick notes on SQCAS configuration in the Apache server.

Find the if mod_perl section:
<IfModule mod_perl.c>
# always set this to on under mod_perl (I think it should be in the default)
    PerlTaintCheck On
# some modules we can preload.
    PerlModule Apache::DBI DBD::mysql CGI SQCAS SQCAS::DB

# This is a sample <Location> directive. You can have as many of
# these as you need to define your site.
	<Location /SQCAS>
# this section specifies that access to anything under this location
# needs to be authorized by SQCAS
	    AuthName 'SQCAS'
		AuthType Custom
		PerlAuthenHandler SQCAS::Apache::Authorization
		require valid-user
		
# This sets up this location as handled by mod_perl
	    SetHandler perl-script
		PerlHandler Apache::Registry
		PerlSendHeader On
# Comment this out if you are using only handlers
		Options +ExecCGI
		
# this should allow .htaccess files to overide settings here
		AllowOverride All

# here's an example of setting defaults. SQCAS::Apache::Authorization will look
# to see if CLIENT was passed as an argument then check to see if it's defined
# in apaches conf's somewhere
        PerlSetVar CLIENT 1
	</Location>
	
# the login and authenticate handlers have to be outside of the restricted
# location(s) in order to be accessible. NewUser would need to be as well
	<Location /login>
	    SetHandler perl-script
	    PerlHandler SQCAS::Apache::Login
	</Location>
	<Location /authenticate>
	    SetHandler perl-script
	    PerlHandler SQCAS::Apache::Authentication
	</Location>

</IfModule>
